# M2E Settings

Provide consistent Eclipse IDE settings for your team from a Maven POM.
The M2E Settings plugin will copy formatting, findbugs and other plugin
settings from a centrally maintained settings JAR to your workspace and
configure each project to use those settings.

 - uses the Maven Eclipse Plugin settings as a base
 - configure once, set everywhere
 - version control your settings

See readme [https://github.com/antoine-morvan/m2e-settings/blob/master/readme.markdown](https://github.com/antoine-morvan/m2e-settings/blob/master/readme.markdown).
